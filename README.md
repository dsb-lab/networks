# Network Selector Example

This is a simple web application built with JavaScript and Cytoscape.js that allows the user to choose between six different networks to display. Each network has the same styles and layouts.

To use this application, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The dropdown menu at the top of the page allows you to select between the six different networks.

This example demonstrates how to use Cytoscape.js to create interactive visualizations of complex networks in web applications.
